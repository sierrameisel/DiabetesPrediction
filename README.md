Designed and implemented a Linear Regression model to predict hospital stay durations for diabetic patients using Python, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Utilized features including lab procedures, medication counts, glucose levels, and A1C test results for model training.
Enhanced model performance by reducing overfitting through cross-validation and regularization, achieving a 50% reduction in RMSE.
